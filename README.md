# PowerBI_DataAnalysis_Credit-Card-Defaults

## Data: The data is about the credit card defaults that happened back in Taiwan in 2005.

## Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Dataset Repository. Last column is additional column that contains fake geo-locations of the USA states just to learn how to visualise geo-location data.

## Output: Appealing and Interactive Visual Report

## STEPS TO FOLLOW:
1. Load the data in POWER PI Desktop app

2. Transformation of Data: 

    2.1. Corrected the column names by transforming data feature so that they would be descriptive
    
    2.2. Replaced the IDs of columns such as Sex, Education, Marriage with meaningful data for the dashboard
    
3. Start with the Report

    3.1. Bar charts are used to show default as per marital status/sex/education level, and also line chart.
    
    3.2. Map Preview was added from options->preview features->show map preview checked
    
    3.3. Card is used to show ratio of default
    
    3.4. Slicers are also used because when we use gender in legend we can't see the scenario of both
